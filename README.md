# Automation Testing for Demo Shopping Web App
This repository contains the automation testing framework for a demo shopping web application, built using Selenium, TestNG, and Cucumber. The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, which enhances code maintainability and reusability by separating test logic from UI interactions.

## Key Features:
Selenium WebDriver: Automates browser actions to perform end-to-end testing on the web app. 

TestNG: Provides robust test configuration, execution, and reporting.

Cucumber BDD: Enables behavior-driven development by writing test scenarios in a human-readable format (Gherkin language).

Page Object Model (POM): Implements a structured way to organize web element locators and actions, improving test scalability.

Reusable Components: Modularized test scripts for easier maintenance and updates.
